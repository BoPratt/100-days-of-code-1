# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to go for it and dig into Python.

**Thoughts:** Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial that I never finished months ago. Decided to start from the beginning as a refresher course. Also using GitHub for the first time ever, so excited to integrate that into my knowledge bank.

**Hours Worked:** 1.25

### Day 2: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Actually woke up at 5am and decided to just work while the world was quiet. I'm enjoying the productive feeling. Worked up until the exercises on Conditional Methods. And then worked past it later in the day.

**Hours Worked:** 2.75

### Day 3: June 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial.

### Day 4: June 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial.

**Thoughts:** So I was working on an exercise and when looking up string methods, overlooked the title() method. So I spent 30 mins trying to split and capitalize a string then re-add it. Almost had it but there was a bug when adding it back to the main list that I didnt figure out. Then I saw the title() method and had to just laugh.

**Hours Worked:** 1.25

### Day 6: June 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial.

### Day 7: June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Spun my wheels today. I re learned things from yesterday but my brain wasnt taking in any more info because I was cramming all day yesterday for A+ 1001 an I took the test today (and passed). I was just too tired to give this my all but I made sure that I did something small.

**Hours Worked:** 25 mins

### Day 8: July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Worked on Lambdas. I remember how hard these were for me to grasp in the past. I understand that they are a function and how to replace a written function but I need more practice and study to make it click.

**Hours Worked:** 1 hr

### Day ???: July 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial.

**Thoughts:** So I missed a day when I was studying to pass the first half of the A+ exam and then my coding was spotty so I decided that Im going to start the days over. However Im not keeping track at the moment. Today I learned that I should start writing psuedo code to help me stay focused and I also want to start posting my code examples, so I will create a file on Git for each example. Today I worked on a marble betting game.

**Hours Worked:** 1 hr

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
