# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to go for it and dig into Python.

**Thoughts:** Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial that I never finished months ago. Decided to start from the beginning as a refresher course. Also using GitHub for the first time ever, so excited to integrate that into my knowledge bank.

**Hours Worked:** 1.25

### Day 2: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Scrimba Python tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Actually woke up at 5am and decided to just work while the world was quiet. I'm enjoying the productive feeling. Worked up until the exercises on Conditional Methods. And then worked past it later in the day.

**Hours Worked:** 2.75

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
